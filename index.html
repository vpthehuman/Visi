            <p>Visi, is my brother. I wanted a sister, but okay. He talks too loud, louder than a big big speaker. He also likes crap music and wears black or white all the time. He shouts randomly, even in public. He can't keep it low - he shuts door like we can make a new one everyday. He also sometimes forgets to flush the toilet. Oh wait! That is everytime actually. He drives like he needs to pee urgently. Also, he loves to bang at doors like there is an earthquake going on and we need to vacate urgently. People say metro cities are most noisy. No no no no they are wrong. Visistah is the ultimate noise pollution king.</p>
